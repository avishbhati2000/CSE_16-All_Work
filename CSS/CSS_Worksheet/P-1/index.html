        <h1>How Technology Is Affecting New Generation</h1>
        <p>Technology is having a powerful impact on the new generation,
            shaping the way young people think, learn, and communicate.
            With smartphones, social media, and the internet at their fingertips, 
            today’s youth are more connected to the world than ever before. 
            It has made learning faster and more accessible, allowing students to explore 
            any topic instantly. However, this constant connectivity also brings challenges like reduced attention spans,
            overreliance on digital devices, and less face-to-face interaction. While technology encourages creativity, 
            innovation, and global awareness, it’s important for the new generation to balance its use so they can enjoy 
            its benefits without losing real-world experiences and human connections.</p>
